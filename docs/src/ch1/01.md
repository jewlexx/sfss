# Installation

The easiest, and recommended way to install SFSU is to use the [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) package manager, like so:

```powershell
scoop bucket add extras
# Or, for all the cool stuff I have in my personal bucket as well
scoop bucket add juliette https://github.com/jewlexx/personal-scoop.git

scoop install sfsu
```

This will install the latest version of sfsu, ready for use.

Otherwise, you can download the latest executable from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/jewlexx/sfsu/releases/latest)

All releases are checked automatically on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
